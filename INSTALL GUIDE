MP3 SERVICE INSTALL GUIDE
--------------------------

This application runs as a Windows Service which polls a source folder for new files at specified
intervals. The service provides the following functionality for audio files:

- Populate and cleanse ID3 fields and file properties according to rules derived from regular expressions
- Determine the beats per minute of the track within a given range and apply this to the ID3 tag
- Log service actions via 'MP3ServiceLog.log' generated in the BasePath

Files are processed and published to output directories; all of which are configurable 
via mp3Service.app.config. Files under 40mb are sent to the BasePath directory and those over 40mb 
will be treated as sets/compilations and sent to the DesktopPath directory.

Pre-req: .NET Framework 4.0

1. Download and extract the project

2. Setup 'mp3Service.app.config' note: this must be done before starting the service

   Open 'mp3Service.app.config' in notepad and edit the following:


    <add key="BasePath" value="C:\input" />
    Base directory for new files to be consumed by the service
    
    <add key="DesktopPath" value="c:\sets" />
    Path to publish files over 40mb
    
    <add key="LocalPath" value="C:\output" />
    Path to publish files under 40mb
    
    <add key="IncludeShare" value="FALSE" />
    Files will also be published to a NetworkPath if TRUE
    
    <add key="NetworkPath" value="\\unc\path" />
    Path to publish files if IncludeShare is TRUE
    
    <add key="PollInterval" value="40000" />
    Folder polling interval in ms
    
    
3. Ensure settings for step 2 are correct. As administrator, run 'Install Service.bat' which will
   install and attempt to start the service.
 
4. Run 'Services.msc'

5. If successful 'MP3 Service' should be running. Open <BasePath>\MP3ServiceLog.log to view service status.
